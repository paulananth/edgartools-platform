## Milestone Requirements

### Node Verification — MDM ↔ Graph

- [x] **NODE-01**: MDM active `company` entity count matches Snowflake `GRAPH_NODE_COMPANY` view count.
- [x] **NODE-02**: MDM active `adviser` entity count matches `GRAPH_NODE_ADVISER` view count.
- [x] **NODE-03**: MDM active `person` entity count matches `GRAPH_NODE_PERSON` view count.
- [x] **NODE-04**: MDM active `security` entity count matches `GRAPH_NODE_SECURITY` view count.
- [x] **NODE-05**: MDM active `fund` entity count matches `GRAPH_NODE_FUND` view count.
- [x] **NODE-06**: A `GRAPH_NODE_AUDIT_FIRM` view exists (currently missing) and its count matches MDM active `audit_firm` entity count (10 seeded Big4/Next6 firms).

### Relationship Verification — MDM ↔ Graph

- [x] **EDGE-01**: `IS_INSIDER` (person→company) — populated; graph parity holds.
- [x] **EDGE-02**: `HOLDS` (person→security) — populated; graph parity holds.
- [x] **EDGE-03**: `COMPANY_HOLDS` (company→security) — populated; graph parity holds.
- [x] **EDGE-04**: `ISSUED_BY` (security→company) — populated; graph parity holds.
- [ ] **EDGE-05**: `IS_ENTITY_OF` (adviser→company) — **no bronze/silver artifact dependency**: pairing comes from MDM's own `mdm_adviser.linked_company_entity_id` resolver field, not from a source document. Currently zero; investigate whether the resolver step that populates this field has ever run, and either populate or document why linkage can't be established (e.g. no adviser CIK in-universe also files as a company).
- [ ] **EDGE-06**: `IS_PERSON_OF` (adviser→person) — **no bronze/silver artifact dependency**: pairing comes from an adviser↔person CIK crosswalk (`MdmAdviser.cik == MdmPerson.owner_cik`), not from a source document. Currently zero; investigate whether any individual-adviser CIKs in-universe also have Form 3/4/5-derived `MdmPerson` records, and either populate or document why no crosswalk matches exist.
- [ ] **EDGE-07**: `MANAGES_FUND` (adviser→fund) — **source artifact: ADV primary attachment documents** (feed `sec_adv_private_fund`). Confirmed unobtainable: all 30 ADV filings in the active universe are EDGAR paper filings with no electronic document (see `.planning/workstreams/claude-mdm-source-recovery/FINDINGS.md`). Document as a source-coverage exclusion — no further artifact action is possible from EDGAR.
- [ ] **EDGE-08**: `HAS_PARENT_COMPANY` (company→company) — **no artifact captured or parsed at all** for parent/subsidiary structure (would require 10-K Exhibit 21 or similar, which is not in the current parser surface). This is a missing-parser gap, not a missing-artifact gap — distinct from EDGE-07. Document as a source-coverage exclusion.
- [ ] **EDGE-09**: `EMPLOYED_BY` (person→company) — **source artifact: DEF 14A proxy filing documents** (feed `sec_executive_record`). Verify DEF 14A bronze artifacts are actually captured for the active universe. If artifacts are present but `sec_executive_record` is still empty, root-cause the parser/pipeline gap; if artifacts themselves are missing, triage fetchability before concluding a coverage exclusion.
- [ ] **EDGE-10**: `AUDITED_BY` (company→audit_firm) — **source artifact: SEC companyfacts (XBRL entity-facts) API responses** (feed `sec_accounting_flag.auditor_pcaob_id`). Artifact is confirmed fetchable (not a paper-filing-style dead end) — populate once a fundamentals entity-facts run publishes to the unified `silver/sec/silver.duckdb` (coordinate with the `fundamental-factors-v2` workstream — do not run fundamentals in dev without checking for overlap).
- [x] **EDGE-11**: `INSTITUTIONAL_HOLDS` (adviser→security) — **source artifact: 13F-HR INFORMATION TABLE XML documents** (feed `sec_thirteenf_holding`). Verify 13F bronze artifacts are actually captured for institutional advisers in the active universe. If artifacts are present but the table is still empty, root-cause the parser/pipeline gap; if artifacts themselves are missing, triage fetchability before concluding a coverage exclusion.

### Cross-Cutting Graph Verification

- [ ] **GVER-01**: `mdm verify-graph` output distinguishes Native App readiness failures (e.g. no compute pool available) from actual MDM↔graph parity failures.
- [ ] **GVER-02**: Any Neo4j Graph Analytics Native App capability still broken app-side (GRAPH_INFO, BFS, LIST_GRAPHS per PR #122 findings) is fixed or documented with exact reproducing commands/dates, distinct from MDM-side issues.
- [x] **GVER-03**: Repeated MDM relationship derivation AND repeated graph sync against unchanged data produce zero drift (idempotent) across all 6 node types and 11 relationship types. (Graph-sync/full-rebuild side proven by 05-01's `test_graph_sync_is_idempotent_full_rebuild`; node/relationship-derivation side proven by 05-02's `test_node_resolution_is_idempotent_across_entity_types` and `test_audit_firm_seed_is_idempotent` — both halves complete.)

### Missing Source Artifacts

Per-relationship artifact triage (which source documents feed which relationship, and whether
they're fetchable) is captured directly in EDGE-05 through EDGE-11 above rather than as a
separate generic audit — each relationship's artifact dependency (or explicit absence of one)
is stated where it's actionable. This section covers only the two cross-cutting artifact-integrity
mechanisms that aren't tied to any single relationship type.

- [ ] **ARTF-01**: Silver-publishing warehouse commands (`parse-adv-bronze` and peers) never overwrite a healthier canonical `silver.duckdb` with a smaller/incomplete local copy — publish is skipped or guarded when the local copy would regress the canonical.
- [ ] **ARTF-02**: Any newly-captured artifact fetch (from EDGE-09/EDGE-11 triage or elsewhere) honors SEC idempotency (DEC-009) — already-captured filings are not re-fetched without an explicit `--force`.

### edgartools Crosscheck

- [ ] **EDGX-01**: A documented sample-filing comparison shows whether platform-parsed ownership/ADV/financials output agrees with `edgartools`-produced output for the same filings, with discrepancies explained.
- [ ] **EDGX-02**: Each hand-built parser in the platform (ownership, ADV, financials) is evaluated against current `edgartools` coverage; parsers with equivalent, well-supported edgartools coverage are replaced or have a documented reason not to be.
- [ ] **EDGX-03**: Platform's edgartools API usage (imports, call patterns) is audited against the pinned version's current, non-deprecated surfaces per the edgartools changelog.

## Future Requirements

- [ ] IARD/IAPD ingestion pipeline (non-EDGAR data source) to recover structured ADV adviser/private-fund data that paper filings cannot provide — new pipeline, out of this milestone's scope.
- [ ] Automated recurring edgartools-vs-platform drift detection (rather than a one-time documented sample comparison).

## Out Of Scope

- Building a new non-EDGAR ADV data source (IARD/IAPD) — the paper-filing gap is documented, not solved, this milestone.
- Running fundamentals entity-facts loads that conflict with the active `fundamental-factors-v2` workstream without explicit coordination.
- Real prod (AWS account `077127448006`, Snowflake `EDGARTOOLS_PROD`) — dev (`690839588395`) and `EDGARTOOLS_PRODB` only.
- Non-AWS deployment paths, registries, storage targets, or secret-management paths (DEC-001).
- Gold table/dbt model redesign unrelated to proving the relationship/graph verification path.
