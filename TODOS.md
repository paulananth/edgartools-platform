## INSTITUTIONAL_HOLDS full-universe sync: batch-by-CIK-range to avoid OOM

**What:** Before writing the Phase 6 full-universe sync plan (06-03), design a
batched-read strategy for `INSTITUTIONAL_HOLDS` that reads `sec_thirteenf_holding`
in CIK-range chunks instead of a single `silver.fetch()` call.

**Why:** `SilverDatabase.fetch()` returns `list[dict]` — all rows in memory at
once. `sec_thirteenf_holding` is the largest silver table: large fund managers
(Vanguard, BlackRock) report tens of thousands of positions per quarter. With
multiple years of fundamentals silver data, a full scan could be 10M+ rows
in a single list. ECS task memory limits make this a realistic OOM risk.

**Where:** `edgar_warehouse/mdm/pipeline.py:_derive_institutional_holds` uses
`_fetch_optional_relationship_rows`, which calls `silver.fetch(sql)` with no
chunking. The `_bounded_relationship_sql` helper only applies LIMIT when
`remaining` is not None.

**Fix approach:** Add a CIK-range batch loop in `_derive_institutional_holds`
that queries `sec_thirteenf_holding WHERE cik BETWEEN ? AND ?` in configurable
increments (e.g., 1000 CIKs per batch). The adviser-entity resolution is
per-CIK, so the ordering requirement doesn't apply — this deriver is safely
batchable.

**Depends on:** Phase 6 06-03 full-universe sync plan (write this before that plan)

## COMPANY_HOLDS `skipped_corporate` counter: clarify semantic inversion

**What:** Add an inline comment to `_derive_company_holds` in `pipeline.py`
explaining that `skipped_corporate` means "skipped because owner is NOT a
company" — the inverse of how the same counter reads in `_derive_is_insider`
and `_derive_holds` (where it means "skipped because owner IS a company").

**Why:** The 5-counter interface (`skipped_corporate`, `skipped_unresolved_source`,
etc.) is consistent across all derivers. But the semantics of `skipped_corporate`
flip between derivers that want non-corporate owners (IS_INSIDER, HOLDS) and
derivers that want corporate owners (COMPANY_HOLDS). A future reader or AI agent
could misread the counter and think COMPANY_HOLDS is misbehaving.

**Where:** `edgar_warehouse/mdm/pipeline.py:_derive_company_holds` around line 563.

**Fix:** One-line comment: `# skipped_corporate here means non-corporate owner
(inverse of IS_INSIDER — COMPANY_HOLDS wants corporate owners only)`

## backfill_accounting_flags selects nonexistent forensic-score columns from sec_financial_derived

**What:** `backfill_accounting_flags` (`edgar_warehouse/parsers/accounting_flags.py:51-64`)
runs a `SELECT` against `sec_financial_derived` that includes
`beneish_m_score, altman_z_score, piotroski_f_score`. These columns do not
exist on `sec_financial_derived` — the table DDL
(`edgar_warehouse/silver_store.py` around line 437) explicitly notes forensic
scores live exclusively on `sec_accounting_flag` and are intentionally not
denormalised onto `sec_financial_derived`.

**Why:** DuckDB raises a `BinderException` (referenced column not found) the
moment this query runs, so `backfill_accounting_flags` fails for every CIK
that reaches the post-processing step in `bootstrap_fundamentals`
(`edgar_warehouse/application/commands/bootstrap_fundamentals.py:126-130`).
Forensic scores (Beneish M, Altman Z, Piotroski F) are never backfilled.

**Where:**
- `edgar_warehouse/parsers/accounting_flags.py:51-64` — the offending SELECT.
- `edgar_warehouse/silver_store.py:~437-441` — DDL comment confirming the
  columns are intentionally absent from `sec_financial_derived`.

**Fix approach:** Drop `beneish_m_score, altman_z_score, piotroski_f_score`
from the `sec_financial_derived` SELECT in `accounting_flags.py`. The `prev`
row's prior-period values for these scores (used as fallbacks via
`row.get("beneish_m_score")` etc. at lines 77/80/85) should instead be sourced
from `sec_accounting_flag` (the table that actually carries them), via a
second query or a join — needs design before implementing.

## sec_financial_fact PK omits period_end — same-period restatements collide and silently drop ~58% of facts

**What:** `sec_financial_fact`'s primary key is
`(cik, accession_number, concept, fiscal_period, segment)`
(`edgar_warehouse/silver_store.py:404`) — it does not include `period_end`.
When a single accession's XBRL data contains multiple facts for the same
`(concept, fiscal_period, segment)` but with *different* `period_end` dates
(common for comparative-period restatements in 10-Q/10-K filings — e.g. a
Q3 filing reporting both the current-quarter and a restated prior-year
quarter under the same `fiscal_period` label), those rows collide on the PK
and only one survives.

**Why:** Confirmed empirically via the merge-perf differential test on real
Apple (CIK 320193) `companyfacts` data: 24,195 raw fact rows reduce to
10,227 stored rows after merge — a ~58% reduction. Spot-checked rows show
the *value* is preserved correctly (last-write-wins, by design) but the
*period_end* recorded against that value can belong to a different filing's
period than the value itself — e.g.
`(320193, '0000320193-17-000009', 'Q3', 'AccountsPayableCurrent', value=31915000000.0)`
is stored with `period_end=2016-09-24` even when other rows in the same
batch carry `period_end=2017-07-01` for the same PK. Downstream consumers
joining on `period_end` for this PK get a mismatched value/period pairing.

**Where:** `edgar_warehouse/silver_store.py:404` (PK definition) and the
`merge_financial_facts` UPSERT logic that depends on it
(`edgar_warehouse/silver_store.py:2020-2078`).

**Fix approach:** Needs design discussion — likely either (a) add
`period_end` to the PK (changes UPSERT/dedup semantics significantly, may
need a migration for existing data), or (b) determine whether the ~58%
"duplicates" are actually the *same* economic fact reported under multiple
accessions/periods (in which case current behavior may be correct and the
58% figure is expected dedup, not data loss) — confirm with a sample audit
before deciding the PK needs to change.
