## INSTITUTIONAL_HOLDS full-universe sync: batch-by-CIK-range to avoid OOM

**What:** Before writing the Phase 6 full-universe sync plan (06-03), design a
batched-read strategy for `INSTITUTIONAL_HOLDS` that reads `sec_thirteenf_holding`
in CIK-range chunks instead of a single `silver.fetch()` call.

**Why:** `SilverDatabase.fetch()` returns `list[dict]` — all rows in memory at
once. `sec_thirteenf_holding` is the largest silver table: large fund managers
(Vanguard, BlackRock) report tens of thousands of positions per quarter. With
multiple years of fundamentals silver data, a full scan could be 10M+ rows
in a single list. ECS task memory limits make this a realistic OOM risk.

**Where:** `edgar_warehouse/mdm/pipeline.py:_derive_institutional_holds` uses
`_fetch_optional_relationship_rows`, which calls `silver.fetch(sql)` with no
chunking. The `_bounded_relationship_sql` helper only applies LIMIT when
`remaining` is not None.

**Fix approach:** Add a CIK-range batch loop in `_derive_institutional_holds`
that queries `sec_thirteenf_holding WHERE cik BETWEEN ? AND ?` in configurable
increments (e.g., 1000 CIKs per batch). The adviser-entity resolution is
per-CIK, so the ordering requirement doesn't apply — this deriver is safely
batchable.

**Depends on:** Phase 6 06-03 full-universe sync plan (write this before that plan)

## COMPANY_HOLDS `skipped_corporate` counter: clarify semantic inversion

**What:** Add an inline comment to `_derive_company_holds` in `pipeline.py`
explaining that `skipped_corporate` means "skipped because owner is NOT a
company" — the inverse of how the same counter reads in `_derive_is_insider`
and `_derive_holds` (where it means "skipped because owner IS a company").

**Why:** The 5-counter interface (`skipped_corporate`, `skipped_unresolved_source`,
etc.) is consistent across all derivers. But the semantics of `skipped_corporate`
flip between derivers that want non-corporate owners (IS_INSIDER, HOLDS) and
derivers that want corporate owners (COMPANY_HOLDS). A future reader or AI agent
could misread the counter and think COMPANY_HOLDS is misbehaving.

**Where:** `edgar_warehouse/mdm/pipeline.py:_derive_company_holds` around line 563.

**Fix:** One-line comment: `# skipped_corporate here means non-corporate owner
(inverse of IS_INSIDER — COMPANY_HOLDS wants corporate owners only)`
